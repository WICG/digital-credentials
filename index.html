        This document specifies an API to enable [=user agents=] to mediate
        access to, and presentation of, digital credentials such as a driver's
        license, government-issued identification card, and/or [=credential
        type examples|other types of digital credential=]. The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means by which to request a digital
        credential from a user agent or underlying platform.

        This is an unofficial proposal.
      </p>
    </section>
    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document defines an API enabling a website to request presentation
      of a [=digital credential=].
    </p>
    <p>
      The API design is agnostic to both credential presentation [=digital
      credential/exchange protocols=] and credential formats. However, to
      promote interoperability this document includes a
      [[[#protocol-registry]]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The API is designed to support the following goals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep the act of requesting separate from the specific [=digital
      credential/protocol=], thereby enabling the extensibility of the
      [=digital credential/protocol=] and credential formats.
      </li>
      <li>Require [=digital credential/requests=] to be unencrypted, enabling
      user-agent inspection for risk analysis.
      </li>
      <li>Assume [=digital credential/presentation response|responses=] opacity
      (encrypted responses), enabling verifiers and holders to control where
      potentially sensitive personally identifiable information is exposed.
      </li>
      <li>Require [=transient activation=] to perform [=digital
      credential/requests=], ensuring that sites cannot silently query for
      digital credentials nor communicate with wallet providers without the
      user's active participation and confirmation of each action.
      </li>
      <li>Enable platform-provided credential selection UX when multiple wallet
      applications have credentials that match a [=digital
      credential/requests=].
      </li>
      <li>Enable platforms to potentially provide secure cross-device [=digital
      credential/requests=] with proximity checks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="credential-type-examples">
      [=Digital credentials=] of many types can be presented using this API.
      <dfn data-lt="credential type examples">Examples of these types</dfn>
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a driving license, passport, or other identity card issued by a
      government institution
      </li>
      <li>a travel authorization document issued by an embassy or consulate
      </li>
      <li>a proof of employment issued by a public or private organization
      </li>
      <li>a proof of education or professional training issued by an
      institution
      </li>
      <li>and many other scenarios as described in <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">Verifiable Credentials Use
      Cases</a>

          Session Security
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain that once a secure session is established at a website using
          credentials exchanged over this API, that the subsequent security is
          no longer a function of the credential used or this API and is up to
          the session management utilized on the website.

          The documents listed below outline various privacy considerations for
          Digital Credentials, both broadly and for presentation on the web.
          Their contents will be integrated into this document gradually.

          Unnecessary Requests for Credentials
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API could be used to unnecessarily request digital
          credentials from individuals such as requesting a driver's license to
          log into a movie rating website and how the ecosystem can mitigate
          this risk.

          Over Collection of Data
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API could be used to request more data than necessary
          for a transaction and how the ecosystem can mitigate that over
          collection.

          Individual Consent

        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API acquires an individual's consent to share a
          digital credential and how digital wallets can also provide further
          consent when sharing information.

          Explain how verifiers might retain data and what the ecosystem does
          to mitigate excessive data retention policies.

          Compliance with Privacy Regulations
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain to what extent the API complies with known privacy
          regulations (e.g., consent) and what parts of those regulations are
          not possible to enforce via the API (e.g., retention).

          preserve privacy as well as their limitations in doing so.

          Phoning Home

        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how some systems might "phone home", the impact on privacy
          that might have, and what the ecosystem provides to mitigate the
          risk.

          Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain that the API does enable the transmission of personally
          identifiable information and that it does its best to ensure there is
          informed consent by the individual, but that the consent might be
          provided due to exhaustion or not understanding what PII is being
          transmitted and how to mitigate those concerns.
