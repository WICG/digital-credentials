        This document specifies an API to enable [=user agents=] to mediate
        access to, and presentation of, digital credentials such as a driver's
        license, government-issued identification card, and/or [=credential
        type examples|other types of digital credential=]. The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means by which to request a digital
        credential from a user agent or underlying platform.

      The following items are within the scope of this specification:

    <ul>
      <li>Requesting a [=digital credential=], including mechanisms for secure
      presentation.
      </li>
      <li>Ensuring that when an API call is made, the website does not learn
      anything about the a holder's [=digital credentials=] or their software
      unless the [=user agent=] has previously received user consent.
      </li>
      <li>Ensuring that any installed application software will not learn
      anything about a given [=request=] unless the [=holder=] explicitly
      consents to use that software.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following items are out of scope:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Issuance process for establishing a [=digital credential=].
      </li>
      <li>UI/UX considerations, with the exception of privacy considerations,
      which are addressed to ensure the protection of user data during the
      request process.
