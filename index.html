        This document specifies an API to allow user agents to mediate access
        to, and representing, a verifiably-issued digital identity (e.g. a
        government issued digital driver's license, a passport issued by a
        country, a student card or diploma issued by a university, an employee
        card issued by a company, a passenger's boarding pass issued by an
        airline, a profile issued by an online social network, membership
        cards, vaccination records, etc) license). The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means to request a digital identity
        from the user agent or underlying platform.
