        This document specifies an API to enable [=user agents=] to mediate
        access to, and presentation of, digital credentials such as a driver's
        license, government-issued identification card, and/or [=credential
        type examples|other types of digital credential=]. The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means by which to request a digital
        credential from a user agent or underlying platform.

          Unnecessary Requests for Credentials
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API could be used to unnecessarily request digital
          credentials from individuals such as requesting a driver's license to
          log into a movie rating website and how the ecosystem can mitigate
          this risk.

          Over Collection of Data
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API could be used to request more data than necessary
          for a transaction and how the ecosystem can mitigate that over
          collection.

          Individual Consent
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how the API acquires an individual's consent to share a
          digital credential and how digital wallets can also provide further
          consent when sharing information.

          Data Retention
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how verifiers might retain data and what the ecosystem does
          to mitigate excessive data retention policies.

          Compliance with Privacy Regulations
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain to what extent the API complies with known privacy
          regulations (e.g., consent) and what parts of those regulations are
          not possible to enforce via the API (e.g., retention).

          Explain how selective disclosure and unlinkable disclosure help
          preserve privacy as well as their limitations in doing so.

          Phoning Home

        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain how some systems might "phone home", the impact on privacy
          that might have, and what the ecosystem provides to mitigate the
          risk.

          Transmission of Personally Identifiable Information
        </h3>
        <p class="issue" title="Work in progress">
          Explain that the API does enable the transmission of personally
          identifiable information and that it does its best to ensure there is
          informed consent by the individual, but that the consent might be
          provided due to exhaustion or not understanding what PII is being
          transmitted and how to mitigate those concerns.
