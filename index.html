        This document specifies an API to enable [=user agents=] to mediate
        access to, and presentation of, digital credentials such as a driver's
        license, government-issued identification card, and/or [=credential
        type examples|other types of digital credential=]. The API builds on
        [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means by which to request a digital
        credential from a user agent or underlying platform.
