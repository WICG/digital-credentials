        This document specifies an API to allow user agents to mediate access
        to, and representing, a verifiably-issued digital identity (e.g. a government issued digital driver's license, a passport issued by a country, a student card or diploma issued by a university, an employee card issued by a company, a passenger's boarding pass issued by an airline, a profile issued by an online social network, membership cards, vaccination records, etc)  
        license). The API builds on [[[credential-management-1]]] as a means to
        request a digital identity from the user agent or underlying platform.
