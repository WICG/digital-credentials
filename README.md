# Digital Credentials

ðŸ“„ [Digital credentials explainer](explainer.md) and [draft spec](https://wicg.github.io/digital-identities/)


This incubation is attempting to specify an API for user agents that would mediate access to, and representation of, verifiably-issued digital credentials.

These identities can range from government-issued documents, such as driver's licenses and passports, to start with, to other credential types, potentially in the future.

The [Digital Credential API](https://wicg.github.io/digital-identities/) builds upon the [Credential Management standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/) to enable the secure and private exchange of digital identity information. It facilitates authenticated interactions by representing digital credentials through the `DigitalIdentity` interface, which embodies verifiable claims about an individual's identity.

## Scope

This project covers the requesting mechanisms for digital credentials, including secure presentation aspects. It does not yet encompass the issuance process for establishing a digital identity nor UI/UX considerations beyond privacy aspects related to data protection during the request process.

## Trying out the API

**ðŸš§ Note: The API is still extremely unstable and undergoing a lot of changes (almost daily!). ðŸš§**

However, if you want to try it out:

- [Try out the API in Chrome](https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/wiki/HOWTO%3A-Try-the-Prototype-API-in-Chrome-Android)

## Contributing

This is an unofficial proposal under development. Contributions, feedback, and discussions are highly encouraged to refine and enhance the API specification.
